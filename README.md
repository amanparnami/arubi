The goal of our project is to enable end-users to build and test ubiquitous computing applications visually and in-situ without writing code. We propose the use of a tablet-based mixed GUI/AR interface to enable end-users to visualize, appropriate, and program input/output devices and services in the environment. We plan to demonstrate our application with custom hardware using two scenarios set in the 1) home and 2) classroom. In the home scenario, we will simulate a student’s day from the time they wake up until they are ready to leave for class. A number of interactions from the bedroom (e.g. alarm clock, blinds, music) to the living room (e.g. on-body sensors, TV notifications, Kinect gestures) will be configured by the user and demonstrated using custom hardware, sensors and actuators. In the classroom scenario, we will demonstrate how the professor or IT support is able to program the classroom and dynamically switch ‘modes’ (e.g. presentation, video, discussion, blackboard mode) by changing content projected on screen, moving projection screens, and controlling lights through various modalities (e.g. sensing, Kinect, speech).
